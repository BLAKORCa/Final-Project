# Final-Project
Data set of 315 bird species.45980 training images, 1575 test images(5 images per species) and 1575 validation images (5 images per species.Each figure has 224 Ã— 224 resolution. For preprocessing, we want to use PCA to decrease the dimensions of each data sample so that we can make data more centralized and decrease noise. In addition, if our model meet underfittting problem, we use shifted graphs to augmenting the total size of data. Ideally, we will do the unsupervised task by dropping labels and implement clustering on the data set.
